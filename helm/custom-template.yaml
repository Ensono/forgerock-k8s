# Example of setting the registry to blank - so the local docker cache is consulted instead of a registry.
# You must have the double quotes if you want a blank registry.
registry: ""

# You must configure at least one stack source.
# This is where the ForgeRock stack configuration comes from:
# gitRepo - clones the example source from gitHub or other git repo. https://stash.forgerock.org/scm/cloud/forgeops-init.git
# is a starter repo.
# hostPath - maps to a local directory on your laptop. This only works for Minikube / VirtualBox.
# For rapid development, use hostPath, and map to a local folder. This folder can be cloned from a starter git repo, and later
# pushed to another repo, branched, tagged, etc.
# Note that stackSource can be *any* volume that supplies configuration. You could use a PVC here, as an example.
stackConfigSource:
#  gitRepo:
#    repository: https://stash.forgerock.org/scm/cloud/forgeops-init.git
#    revision: release/5.0.0
  hostPath:
    path: /Users/YOUR-USER-ID/tmp/config
# If you don't want any config files you can use an emptyDir:
#  emptyDir: {}

# Tune DJ for a larger cluster:
#opendjJavaArgs: "-server -Xmx2g -XX:+UseG1GC"
#djCPULimit:  "1"
#djMemoryLimit: "2Gi"

# The cookie domain for the deployment.
# This will be used to form the FQDN for all of the products.
# example:  {openidm,openam,openig}.example.com
cookieDomain: .example.com

# Sample values you might use on GKE.
# repo should be your Google Project ID.
# Remember to set the trailing / on registry.
#registry: gcr.io/
#repo: engineering-devops

# Use a storageClass on GKE to get fast SSD disk.
#persistence:
#  storageClass: fast

# Enable Fluented logging to GKE. This will send log output to stackdriver / cloud logging console.
# Experimental
# gkeLogging: true
